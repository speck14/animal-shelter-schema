# animal-shelter-schema
JSON schema practice, using animals in an animal shelter

## PT story description
Create, from scratch, a json-schema for some sort of collection: albums, stamps, movies, buttons, rocks etc. You can pick the subject. Your schema should include the following:

1. `$schema`, `$id`, schema keywords
2. `description` and `title` annotations
3. `required`, `type` validation keywords
4. `minimum` validation keyword
5. at least one `array` property
6. `minItems` validation keyword

all in a single self-contained schema file. 

Also include 3-4 sample data examples that match the schema you have created. 

## Extend your JSON schema example
Refactor your previously created schema into 2-3 separate schemas using the $ref keyword. If necessary, you may modify your original schema to provide better a better basis for this refactor (eg: add some object arrays, or nesting if it does not already have such).

Validate your schema and also provide 2-3 examples of data which match it.

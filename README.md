## PT story description
Create, from scratch, a json-schema for some sort of collection: albums, stamps, movies, buttons, rocks etc. You can pick the subject. Your schema should include the following:

1. `$schema`, `$id`, schema keywords
2. `description` and `title` annotations
3. `required`, `type` validation keywords
4. `minimum` validation keyword
5. at least one `array` property
6. `minItems` validation keyword

all in a single self-contained schema file. 

Also include 3-4 sample data examples that match the schema you have created.
